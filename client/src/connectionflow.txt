// Connection flow
Linkages between connectionStatus, where it is set, where it is processed
Same with syncStatus


export enum ConnectionStatus {
    cannotStart = 0,
    navToLoginScreen = 12,
    onLoginScreen = 13,
    loginComplete = 14,
    initialNavComplete = 15
}

connectionStatus starts as / defaults to "cannotStart"
while attempting automated login:
    if errors in the creds (missing, etc.) -> "navToLoginScreen"
    if JWT isn't valid against couchDB -> "navToLoginScreen"
    if JWT refresh token isn't valid against API server -> "navToLoginScreen"
    if "assignDBAndSync" returns an error, -> "navToLoginScreen"
checking syncstatus in useeffect loop -->
    if status is active or paused (as long as NOT connectionStatus of initialNavComplete) -> set to loginComplete    
on initialLoad, if loginComplete ==> initialNavComplete
on initialLoad, if navToLoginScreen ==> onLoginScreen

where checked:
    when connectionStatus changes (in remoteDBState): attempt login -- do only once, but only if not onLoginScreen or loginComplete
    when connectionStatus changes (on initialLoad page) : if loginComplete, set to initialNavComplete and navigate to that onLoginScreen
                                                          if navToLoginScreen, navigate to the login screen
    when connectionStatus changes (on login) : if cannotStart, update state to initial,
                                                if loginComplete, set to initialNavComplete
